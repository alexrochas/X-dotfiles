# X Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles for X configurations like terminal and xscreensaver.

## How-to intall:

```
gem install homesick
homesick clone https://github.com/alexrochas/X-dotfiles
homesick symlink X-dotfiles
homesick rc X-dotfiles
```

[Here](https://gist.github.com/alexrochas/45590646bfd89c9762c94e72bd860990) are the other non-essential dotfiles like **xsession config** and **cronjobs**.
Also, take a look on my other [dotfiles](https://github.com/alexrochas/dotfiles/) like vim and zsh.

*Install with [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick).*
